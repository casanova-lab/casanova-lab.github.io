<h1>Research engineer open position</h1>

<p>The Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases (Director: Dr Laurent Abel) at the Imagine Institute (Institut des Maladies Génétiques), Inserm (Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale)/University Paris Descartes, Paris, France, is looking for a motivated and qualified
*Master student/Engineer* in bioinformatics</p>

<p>Our laboratory is working on the genetic dissection of predisposition to infectious diseases. The lab comprised two teams working on genetic epidemiology and genetic immunology. The union of the two teams is highly synergic, facilitating an integrated approach to studies of the human genetics of infectious diseases. Our laboratory is also benefiting from the establishment of a sister laboratory at the Rockefeller University in New York in the framework of an INSERM-associated international laboratory of human genetics of infectious diseases. The Paris branch is now located within the new Imagine Institute dedicated to the study of genetic disorders, and offering cutting edge research and core facilities.</p>

<p>The selected candidate will be involved in projects on the genetic background of human infectious diseases. He/she will be responsible for the processing and analysis of next-generation sequencing human data (especially whole exome and whole genome, and to a lesser extent RNAseq data), as well as building and managing custom pipelines. He/she will utilize existing tools and software packages while also tailoring and developing them to meet specific project goals. In addition, this person will be responsible for interacting with a team of statistical geneticists and wet-bench investigators. The position will be in the Rockefeller University branch laboratory in New York.</p>


<h3>Qualifications</h3>

<p>M.Sc. (Master 1 or Master 2) in bioinformatics or computational biology,
Familiarity with next-generation sequence data and analysis tools required.</p>

<p>Must be able to work independently and collaboratively.</p>

<p>Highly motivated with strong English communication skills.</p>

<p>Proficiency with at least one programming language (R, Python and/or Perl are preferred) and with bash/shell scripting.</p>

<p>Experience with database management and with high performance computing would be a plus.</p>
